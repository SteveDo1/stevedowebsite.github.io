        <p>Hi, I’m Steve! I’m a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience across security operations, 
          incident response, and risk management. I’ve supported activities such as digital forensics, application security, and offensive security, helping organizations detect, 
          respond to, and mitigate security threats.</p>
        <p>My background includes working with security tools and frameworks to 
          improve visibility, strengthen controls, and support day-to-day security operations</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <p>In addition, I have experience in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), where I’ve contributed to policy development, 
          risk assessments, and compliance efforts aligned with industry standards. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional 
          teams to improve security maturity.</p> 
        <p>I’m motivated by continuous learning and staying ahead of emerging threats in an evolving cybersecurity landscape.</p>

        <p>When I’m not exploring new tools or learning more about cybersecurity, you’ll probably find me building mechanical keyboards, experimenting with new tech, or watching Formula 1.</p>
