          I’m Steve, a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience across security operations, incident response, and risk management. My work spans digital forensics, application security, and offensive security, where I help identify weaknesses, validate risk, and strengthen organizational defenses.

          I’ve worked with a variety of security tools and frameworks to improve visibility, enhance controls, and support day-to-day security operations. I also bring experience in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), contributing to policy development, risk assessments, and alignment with industry standards.

          Driven by continuous learning, I enjoy staying ahead of emerging threats in an evolving cybersecurity landscape. Outside of security, I like building mechanical keyboards, experimenting with new technology, and watching Formula 1.
